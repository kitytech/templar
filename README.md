# templar
"TEMPLate ARchive"

A(-n experimental) data serialization library using templates and restricted to c++11.  Because I'm masochistic (and also coding on embedded systems that ship with old standard libraries).

# Example
This project is in early development, but a demo is provided in `example.cpp`, which will be changing as features are added and tweaked.

# License
Released under the terms of the LGPL, version 2.1.
